    <h2 id="about"> About us</h2>
    <p>A pharmacy was always more than just a place to get your prescription. Patients treated pharmacists as consultants, someone to help them choose an over-the-counter medicine or make sense of a prescription’s dosage and instructions. Always happy to oblige, they rarely had enough information about a person’s medical history, allergies, or treatment plans to give more complete advice. This, however, is changing. The healthcare industry is experiencing transformations and pharmacies are no exception.</p>

    <h3 id="why"> Why you need pharmacy management software</h3>
    <p>
       
        A pharmacy management software is any system used in a pharmacy that helps automate the pharmacy workflow. This includes such tasks as reviewing physician orders and preparing medications, controlling the inventory and making drug orders, handling billing and insurance, providing counseling, identifying incompatibilities, and more — all while following legal protocols and compliances.

        And these are just the traditional functions that can be automated. Many more features can give the pharmacy a competitive edge by providing better customer experience and attract patients with more personalized and engaging service. We will talk in detail about such features in the following section. Now, let’s go through the main benefits a pharmacy management system will help you get.

        Improving pharmacists efficiency. Pharmacists spend most of their working hours dispensing drugs. This task requires lots of concentration, a great deal of verification, drug interaction checking, not to mention making sense of the doctor’s handwriting. Is it necessary to dispense drugs manually? Not at all. With seamless computer-computer communication in place, prescriptions can be easily handled by software, freeing more time for pharmacists to interact with patients. Which leads us to the next benefit.
